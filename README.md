# Bike-Shop-Data-Analysis-with-SQL-and-Power-BI
This project involves analyzing two years' worth of data for a bike shop to gain actionable insights into business performance. I utilized SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for creating an interactive dashboard to visualize key metrics.


Objectives
Understand sales trends over the two years.
Evaluate performance across different time periods and locations.

Tools Used
SQL: For querying and preparing the dataset.
Power BI: For building an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
Database: [ MySQL]
Power BI Features: DAX measures, slicers, filters, and custom visuals.

Key Insights
Sales Trends: [Example: Monthly revenue increased by 15% in the second year.]

Dashboard Preview
A sneak peek of the dashboard includes:

Steps in the Project
Data Collection: Imported the dataset into the SQL database.
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Cleaned and transformed raw data using SQL queries to prepare it for visualization.
Dashboard Creation: Connected the SQL database to Power BI, created relationships, and developed visualizations.
Future Enhancements
Adding predictive analysis for future sales.
Integrating data from more years to observe long-term trends.
